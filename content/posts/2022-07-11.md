Today, it is difficult to find a moment of rest for the ambitious person. We get bombarded with information daily. Ads,
new products, social feeds, emails... As soon as we have consumed the information we just had in front of our face, the
media world has more data in line ready to be consumed.


This produces the problem we all have felt at some time during our stay on the internet: brain fog. You see, since the
internet has been centered around big media companies during the last years, the original intent of why the
internet was created has been lost:
sharing. The internet was not a thought or a replacement to TV or books.


Instead, it was born to allow people to share
their ideas, freely. As a community grows, all the members grow from the share of information. Should a member refuse to
contribute, the community loses a member from which to learn, a new tutor. Or, as usually referred in P2P
communications, [a leech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leecher_(computing)).


I might not be the best teacher or person from which to learn many concepts. But knowing that most mass media producing
sites are not helpful for the average internet user, I intend to try to help at least a bit by writing on this blog.


I can only hope that many more people do the same, so they can share what they know to many other people.


See you soon.
